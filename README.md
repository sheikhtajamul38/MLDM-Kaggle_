# README: Sleep State Detection Competition

## Overview

Welcome to the Sleep State Detection Competition! Our aim is to leverage data science for the analysis of wrist-worn accelerometer data to detect sleep onset and wake states. This has profound implications for sleep research, especially for children and youth with mood and behavior difficulties.

## Goal

The primary goal is to develop models that accurately determine a person's sleep state from accelerometer data. Accurate detection of sleep and wake periods will enable researchers to conduct more comprehensive sleep studies.

## Context

Understanding sleep is crucial for overall health, impacting everything from development to cognitive functioning. However, current sleep research faces challenges, particularly in naturalistic data capture and accurate annotation. This competition seeks to address these challenges by improving the analysis of accelerometer data for sleep monitoring.

## Models Implemented

1. **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method used for classification, regression, and other tasks. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. 
   - **Accuracy:** 44%

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** A type of artificial neural network where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.
   - **Accuracy:** 66%

3. **DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention):** An enhanced BERT model using disentangled attention and a two-stage training process to improve language understanding.
   - **Accuracy:** 72%

## Impact

Successful outcomes from this competition will enhance the ability to conduct large-scale, reliable sleep studies. This can lead to a better understanding of sleep patterns and disturbances, particularly in children, and inform the development of targeted interventions and treatment strategies.

## Host Organization

The Child Mind Institute (CMI) is at the forefront of this effort, working towards better mental health and learning disorder treatments for children and families. The SNF Global Center for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, established at CMI, focuses on accelerating global collaboration in under-researched areas of childrenâ€™s mental health.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge the Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF) for their foundational grant and ongoing support, enabling us to pursue this significant research.
